# exception

This repository contains a simple program that demonstrates how to handle exceptions in a calculator. The project implements three types of exceptions: ArithmeticException for calculation errors, InputMismatchException for typos that don't match numbers, and Exception for exceptions in general. The code uses try, catch, and finally statements to handle these exceptions.

Operation
The program asks the user to enter two numbers and a mathematical operation. Next, it performs the operation and handles any exceptions that might occur during processing.
